Inside of each folder (PyBank and  PyPoll) there contains:

- The main script to run for each analysis called "main.py".
- A "Resources" folder that contains the CSV files used.
- An "analysis" folder that contains the text file that has the results from my analysis.

## PyBank
Created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a fake company. Used a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.


Created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:


- The total number of months included in the dataset

- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

- Calculated the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then found the average of those changes

- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

- Printed the analysis to the terminal and exported a text file with the results

## PyPoll
Created a Python script for helping a fake small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.


Used a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. Created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:


- The total number of votes cast

- A complete list of candidates who received votes

- The percentage of votes each candidate won

- The total number of votes each candidate won

- The winner of the election based on popular vote.

- Printed the analysis to the terminal and exported a text file with the results
